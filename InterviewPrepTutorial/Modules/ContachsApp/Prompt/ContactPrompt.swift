 *** PROBLEM STATEMENT ***
 Design and implement a simple Contacts App using SwiftUI that provides basic
 functionality similar to the native iPhone Contacts app.
 
 Requirements:
 
 Contact Data:
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Email
 
 View Contacts:
    - Display a vertically scrollable list of contacts.
    - Display contact initials in a circular view for each contact
    - Next to the initials view, display contact first name, last name and email (See UI)
 
 Add a Contact:
    - Provide a screen where users can add new contacts by entering a first name, last name and email.
 
 Edit a Contact:
    - Allow users to edit an existing contact's details.
    - Enable save button only if changes have been made to contact (Bonus)
    - If changes have been made and user tries to exit, show an alert confirmation warning (Bonus)
 
 Search for contacts:
    - Add a search bar to filter contacts
    - Search should be on user's name or email
 
 Delete a Contact:
    - Add deletion button on contact detail screen
    - Add confirmation alert for contact deletion in edit screen (Bonus)
    - Swipe to delete (Bonus feature)
 
 Navigation Logic:
    - Add contact should be a modal sheet
    - Edit contact should be a navigation push to a contact detail screen
 
 The contact list should persist for the session (no need for long-term storage like Core Data).
 
 Follow-Up Questions
 
 1. How would you persist the contact list between app sessions?
 Ans-> Core Data / Swift Data, file storage with Filemanager or Sqlite
 2. Should we use a remote data base for this application?
 Ans -> probabaly yes, Just for backup storage when user were lose there devices.
 3. How would you handle large lists of contacts for performance?
 Ans -> Pagination
